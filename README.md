# Edit the following files with proper OS specific paths. 
# build.xml - ws.jars should point to the jars required on the system. 
# log4j.properties - point to location of the log file used for debugging.
#
# Also when setting up an Eclipse project or using ant to build from command line (or jenkins), note the jar file sequence order matters.  
# 
# In order to avoid 'unable to connect to host' errors, always stay current with the latest version of Firefox and the latest
# version selenium jars.  Also make sure you consider sequence order if using other jar files that may cause a conflict.
